# click:prepare event
#
# This event is psuedo click capture event that event works in
# browsers without DOM Level 3 events. The prepare event is always
# fired before any other click handlers are ran. Calling
# stopPropagation or returning false will prevent the other handlers.
#
# Eventually, if jQuery 2 moves to the standard event and dispatch
# model, all this can go away and we'll just use capture as intended.

if Zepto?
  # All browsers that support Zepto have addEventListener, we can just
  # use native capture here.
