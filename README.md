# Rails Behaviors

Rails Behaviors implements the `data-*` behaviors generated by Rails 3.x.

This is an alternative to [jquery-ujs](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs). Firstly, it is all Coffee goodness. Well, thats mostly good for me. Second, it is written in a modular fashion. This makes it possible to cherry pick the components you need and replace specific functionaly without rewriting the whole thing. Third, it uses built in global ajax events rather than adding its own. O, one more thing, **Zepto**.


## Dependencies

**jQuery 1.7.2+** or **Zepto 0.8+**

You'll need [Sprockets 2](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) if you want to use the gem version. Otherwise you can download the standalone file from the [Downloads](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/downloads) section.


## Installation

rails-behaviors is distributed through the [bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower) package manager.

``` bash
bower install rails-behaviors
```

## Migrating from jquery-ujs

This library handles all the `data-*` behaviors defined in Rails. So its roughly feature for feature identicial with respect to the HTML.

The differences are in the JS interface.

1. There are no `ajax:*` events. jQuery already has global ajax events built in, so there is no point in duplicating that functionality. Doing a find and replace for `"ajax:"` events should give you a good start. You're looking to replace `ajax:success` with `ajaxSuccess`, `ajax:error` with `ajaxError`, etc.
2. There are no global configuration options. Theres no equivalent for `$.rails`. Your probably should have never used that in the first place.

**NOTE** You **can not** use rails-behaviors and jquery-ujs at the same time.
